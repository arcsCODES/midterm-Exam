        <p>“Coffee Bliss Cubes” is a product that was developed by a team of five students to come up with a deliciously enjoyable coffee jelly product. The name reflects what makes our product special “bliss” captures the rich and satisfying taste of coffee, while “cubes” highlight the jelly’s smooth and bite sized texture. Unlike other regular coffee drinks, the product introduces the bold taste of coffee into this chewy refreshing experience that a jelly cube presents. Preparing with good-quality ingredients, the serving should meet the best quality of both flavors and textures combined, hence giving Coffee Bliss Cubes something that is definitely worth trying.

We will also use posters and in-person recommendations to introduce our product to more students and faculty. By maintaining a strong presence and interacting with potential customers, we aim to build excitement and encourage more people to try our coffee jelly. .
